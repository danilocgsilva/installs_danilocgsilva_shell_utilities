# installs_danilocgsilva_shell_utilities

Installs a danilocgsilva utility if it is missing in the current shell execution

**You need a php server to allow the php file shipping this utility do rather complex jsons checkings that cannot be performed by the shell scripts. A local server development can be enouth. As json utility is rather rare and not obvious, I've choosed to use a php script to support the json operations and analysis. Thus, leting the shell script itself little more simple.

**You also need a file in the user directory called .installs_danilocgsilva_shell_utilites_conf in the user folder and inside a single line with the address of php file that will make github checks.
